## üéØ What is this project?

This is a **Personalized Research Assistant** that:
- Creates users with their preferences
- Takes questions from users
- Searches the web for answers
- Uses AI to give personalized responses
- Saves all conversations in a database

**Example:**
- User asks: "What is AI?"
- System searches the web
- AI gives a personalized answer based on user preferences
- Everything is saved for later

## üîÑ How it works?

```
User ‚Üí FastAPI ‚Üí LangChain ‚Üí Web Search ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí Database
```

1. **User** asks a question
2. **FastAPI** receives the request
3. **LangChain** searches the web using Tavily
4. **OpenAI** processes the results
5. **Database** saves the conversation
